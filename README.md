# Noise Floor Oracle

Noise Floor Oracle is a backend-agnostic quantum runtime tool that detects
when further circuit optimization becomes ineffective due to intrinsic
hardware noise.

The tool analyzes error saturation behavior across increasing circuit
depths and identifies the operational noise floor of quantum hardware.

It is designed for use with NISQ-era devices and is compatible with
IBM-style quantum backends.
